# Real Estate Listing Price Prediction

# Project Title:
Real Estate Listing Price Prediction

# Team Members: 
Manmohanbabu Rupanagudi  
Singaram Subramanyan

# Problem/Issue: 
We intend to work on a Machine Learning project to predict a certain piece of real estate's listing price based features such as on the property's location, Square footage, and number of bedrooms.

# Functionality: 
The solution will be using data analysis to identify patterns to train an informed machine learning model trained on a dataset from kaggle that would predict the the estimated listing price of a piece of real estate. We also intend to use techniques such as feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve the overall performance of the machine-learning model.
# Application:
Data Analysis/Machine Learning
# Description of solution:
We will be conducting exploratory data analysis on the dataset found to understand the dataset, and discover any patterns and correlations between the property features and listing price of the dataset. Once we conduct the exploratory data analysis to identify any patterns that may exist in the data, we will create, train, and tune a machine-learning model to predict the estimated listing price of a piece of real estate.
